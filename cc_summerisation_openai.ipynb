code called sum of   question from leak code called sum of two integers it is a medium we are going  two integers it is a medium we are going   two integers it is a medium we are going to jump right into it given two integers  to jump right into it given two integers   to jump right into it given two integers A and B return the sum of the two  A and B return the sum of the two   A and B return the sum of the two integers without using the operators  integers without using the operators   integers without using the operators plus and minus example one we have a  plus and minus example one we have a   plus and minus example one we have a being one and B being two we output  being one and B being two we output   being one and B being two we output three and example two we have two and  three and example two we have two and   three and example two we have two and three and so we output  three and so we output   three and so we output five so we want to add a and b without  five so we want to add a and b without   five so we want to add a and b without using either the Plus or the minus now  using either the Plus or the minus now   using either the Plus or the minus now this question is pretty open-ended so we  this question is pretty open-ended so we   this question is pretty open-ended so we have a lot of freedom with how we want  have a lot of freedom with how we want   have a lot of freedom with how we want to approach this we could theoretically  to approach this we could theoretically   to approach this we could theoretically add a and b to a list and simply return  add a and b to a list and simply return   add a and b to a list and simply return that sum so I could just run this and of  that sum so I could just run this and of   that sum so I could just run this and of course I would get the expected output  course I would get the expected output   course I would get the expected output um another thing I could do is just do  um another thing I could do is just do   um another thing I could do is just do math. exponent of a multiply that with  math. exponent of a multiply that with   math. exponent of a multiply that with math. exponent of B  math. exponent of B   math. exponent of B so if I'm multiplying with the same  so if I'm multiplying with the same   so if I'm multiplying with the same bases that means the exponents are being  bases that means the exponents are being   bases that means the exponents are being added and then what I have to do is take  added and then what I have to do is take   added and then what I have to do is take math.log of that entire thing and wrap  math.log of that entire thing and wrap   math.log of that entire thing and wrap it as an INT and of course once I take  it as an INT and of course once I take   it as an INT and of course once I take care of the zero conditions for A and B  care of the zero conditions for A and B   care of the zero conditions for A and B I could also get a correct answer by  I could also get a correct answer by   I could also get a correct answer by doing this and neither approach really  doing this and neither approach really   doing this and neither approach really uses the plus and minus so I think it is  uses the plus and minus so I think it is   uses the plus and minus so I think it is perfectly acceptable however this  perfectly acceptable however this   perfectly acceptable however this question does want us to use bits and  question does want us to use bits and   question does want us to use bits and bitwise oper ators so switching over to  bitwise oper ators so switching over to   bitwise oper ators so switching over to Binary how would we add say we had  Binary how would we add say we had   Binary how would we add say we had example with a being 2 B being 3 so say  example with a being 2 B being 3 so say   example with a being 2 B being 3 so say I wanted to add two and three how would  I wanted to add two and three how would   I wanted to add two and three how would that look like in binary two is  that look like in binary two is   that look like in binary two is represented with a 1 Zer and three is  represented with a 1 Zer and three is   represented with a 1 Zer and three is represented with a 1 one okay so if I  represented with a 1 one okay so if I   represented with a 1 one okay so if I have this following bit representation  have this following bit representation   have this following bit representation how would I do addition it's just like  how would I do addition it's just like   how would I do addition it's just like regular addition right we look at that  regular addition right we look at that   regular addition right we look at that first digit zero and one that added  first digit zero and one that added   first digit zero and one that added together is just one then we have 1 one  together is just one then we have 1 one   together is just one then we have 1 one that that is 1 Z so we write down the  that that is 1 Z so we write down the   that that is 1 Z so we write down the zero and we carry over the one then one  zero and we carry over the one then one   zero and we carry over the one then one with nothing is just  with nothing is just   with nothing is just one like this and this makes sense  one like this and this makes sense   one like this and this makes sense because this is equivalent to 5 and 2 +  because this is equivalent to 5 and 2 +   because this is equivalent to 5 and 2 + 3 is 5 now the only problem here is we  3 is 5 now the only problem here is we   3 is 5 now the only problem here is we can't use addition so what can we use  can't use addition so what can we use   can't use addition so what can we use instead well there is a pattern on how  instead well there is a pattern on how   instead well there is a pattern on how this is being added if I had zero and  this is being added if I had zero and   this is being added if I had zero and one I would output one if I had one and  one I would output one if I had one and   one I would output one if I had one and zero I would output one if I had zero  zero I would output one if I had zero   zero I would output one if I had zero and zero I would output zero and if I  and zero I would output zero and if I   and zero I would output zero and if I had one and one I would output zero with  had one and one I would output zero with   had one and one I would output zero with a one as  a one as   a one as carry so what does this truth table  carry so what does this truth table   carry so what does this truth table remind us of this is an X or or an  remind us of this is an X or or an   remind us of this is an X or or an exclusive or where we output a one if  exclusive or where we output a one if   exclusive or where we output a one if the digits are different if they're the  the digits are different if they're the   the digits are different if they're the same if we have 0 0 or 1 one we would  same if we have 0 0 or 1 one we would   same if we have 0 0 or 1 one we would output a zero so that takes care of the  output a zero so that takes care of the   output a zero so that takes care of the output we would have without the carry  output we would have without the carry   output we would have without the carry now what about the carry the only time  now what about the carry the only time   now what about the carry the only time we would actually have a carry is if we  we would actually have a carry is if we   we would actually have a carry is if we have the one one condition otherwise  have the one one condition otherwise   have the one one condition otherwise everything else is just zero if we have  everything else is just zero if we have   everything else is just zero if we have a one one then our carry would be one  a one one then our carry would be one   a one one then our carry would be one otherwise we have no carry and this is  otherwise we have no carry and this is   otherwise we have no carry and this is the logical and 0 and 1 is 0 1 and 0 is0  the logical and 0 and 1 is 0 1 and 0 is0   the logical and 0 and 1 is 0 1 and 0 is0 0 and 0 is z and one and one is the only  0 and 0 is z and one and one is the only   0 and 0 is z and one and one is the only time we would actually output  time we would actually output   time we would actually output one so what we're going to do is break  one so what we're going to do is break   one so what we're going to do is break this up into two parts I'm going to have  this up into two parts I'm going to have   this up into two parts I'm going to have the sum without carry being a X or B and  the sum without carry being a X or B and   the sum without carry being a X or B and my carry is just going to be a and b now  my carry is just going to be a and b now   my carry is just going to be a and b now what do I do with this carry that I get  what do I do with this carry that I get   what do I do with this carry that I get right once I get the carry I want to  right once I get the carry I want to   right once I get the carry I want to shift it over one to the left and then  shift it over one to the left and then   shift it over one to the left and then continue my summation so what I'm going  continue my summation so what I'm going   continue my summation so what I'm going to do to this carry is actually shift it  to do to this carry is actually shift it   to do to this carry is actually shift it left by one and then I want to repeat  left by one and then I want to repeat   left by one and then I want to repeat this addition so I'm going to do the sum  this addition so I'm going to do the sum   this addition so I'm going to do the sum without carry and carry again and  without carry and carry again and   without carry and carry again and combine that to make this clearer let's  combine that to make this clearer let's   combine that to make this clearer let's actually look at base 10 again okay say  actually look at base 10 again okay say   actually look at base 10 again okay say I had the following integers that I  I had the following integers that I   I had the following integers that I wanted to add up how would I do it well  wanted to add up how would I do it well   wanted to add up how would I do it well 9 + 4 is 13 so I would write three over  9 + 4 is 13 so I would write three over   9 + 4 is 13 so I would write three over here and I would carry the one so right  here and I would carry the one so right   here and I would carry the one so right now this is my sum without carry and  now this is my sum without carry and   now this is my sum without carry and this up here is my carry now 8 + 6 and  this up here is my carry now 8 + 6 and   this up here is my carry now 8 + 6 and we're going to ignore the carry right  we're going to ignore the carry right   we're going to ignore the carry right now is 14 so I'm going to write a four  now is 14 so I'm going to write a four   now is 14 so I'm going to write a four over here and carry the one and again we  over here and carry the one and again we   over here and carry the one and again we ignore the carry so 7 + 8 is 15 and we  ignore the carry so 7 + 8 is 15 and we   ignore the carry so 7 + 8 is 15 and we carry the one so now we have a sum  carry the one so now we have a sum   carry the one so now we have a sum without carry and a carry but remember  without carry and a carry but remember   without carry and a carry but remember we wanted to add the carries to the sum  we wanted to add the carries to the sum   we wanted to add the carries to the sum we would have had otherwise so what  we would have had otherwise so what   we would have had otherwise so what we're going to do is add the carry and  we're going to do is add the carry and   we're going to do is add the carry and sum without carry together so what I'm  sum without carry together so what I'm   sum without carry together so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add  going to do is I'm going to add   going to do is I'm going to add 543 with 1 1 1 except this needs to be  543 with 1 1 1 except this needs to be   543 with 1 1 1 except this needs to be shifted over by one right so it's going  shifted over by one right so it's going   shifted over by one right so it's going to be something like this and this is  to be something like this and this is   to be something like this and this is just going to be a zero over here we  just going to be a zero over here we   just going to be a zero over here we have 1 1 1 0 plus 543 and we're going to  have 1 1 1 0 plus 543 and we're going to   have 1 1 1 0 plus 543 and we're going to repeat the same thing again so I want to  repeat the same thing again so I want to   repeat the same thing again so I want to add this up and again I'm going to have  add this up and again I'm going to have   add this up and again I'm going to have this over here be sum without carry and  this over here be sum without carry and   this over here be sum without carry and up here is going to be my carry now 3 +  up here is going to be my carry now 3 +   up here is going to be my carry now 3 + 0 is 3 4 + 1 is 5 5 + 1 is 6 and and 1 +  0 is 3 4 + 1 is 5 5 + 1 is 6 and and 1 +   0 is 3 4 + 1 is 5 5 + 1 is 6 and and 1 + 0 is just 1 so now I have a sum without  0 is just 1 so now I have a sum without   0 is just 1 so now I have a sum without carry being 1653 and I have nothing in  carry being 1653 and I have nothing in   carry being 1653 and I have nothing in my carry this means I'm actually done  my carry this means I'm actually done   my carry this means I'm actually done with my addition and my final output is  with my addition and my final output is   with my addition and my final output is 1653 for this original addition right  1653 for this original addition right   1653 for this original addition right here so we're going to do the same thing  here so we're going to do the same thing   here so we're going to do the same thing in binary and I'm actually going to  in binary and I'm actually going to   in binary and I'm actually going to assign sum without carry to be a and my  assign sum without carry to be a and my   assign sum without carry to be a and my carry I'm going to set to be B this  carry I'm going to set to be B this   carry I'm going to set to be B this means that while be greater than zero  means that while be greater than zero   means that while be greater than zero while we still have carries that need  while we still have carries that need   while we still have carries that need processing we're going to set a to be  processing we're going to set a to be   processing we're going to set a to be the sum without carries so that's a X or  the sum without carries so that's a X or   the sum without carries so that's a X or B and we're going to set B to be the  B and we're going to set B to be the   B and we're going to set B to be the carry so that is a anded with b and then  carry so that is a anded with b and then   carry so that is a anded with b and then left shifted by one like this and  left shifted by one like this and   left shifted by one like this and finally we have to return a so I'm going  finally we have to return a so I'm going   finally we have to return a so I'm going to go ahead and remove everything else  to go ahead and remove everything else   to go ahead and remove everything else and we can go ahead and run this      code and it is accepted now before  code and it is accepted now before   code and it is accepted now before submitting there is one small caveat the  submitting there is one small caveat the   submitting there is one small caveat the problem is overflow with python  problem is overflow with python   problem is overflow with python specifically we're not actually bound  specifically we're not actually bound   specifically we're not actually bound with 32 bits so say I had the following  with 32 bits so say I had the following   with 32 bits so say I had the following test case I had -2 and three if I were  test case I had -2 and three if I were   test case I had -2 and three if I were to go ahead and run this we would  to go ahead and run this we would   to go ahead and run this we would actually time  actually time   actually time out and we can see that it has timed out  out and we can see that it has timed out   out and we can see that it has timed out time limit exceeded why is that well  time limit exceeded why is that well   time limit exceeded why is that well let's take a look at -2 and three and  let's take a look at -2 and three and   let's take a look at -2 and three and see exactly what is happening so three  see exactly what is happening so three   see exactly what is happening so three how would I write that in bit form that  how would I write that in bit form that   how would I write that in bit form that is going to be 0 1 1 and say I have  is going to be 0 1 1 and say I have   is going to be 0 1 1 and say I have eight bits so that's going to be 0 0 0 0  eight bits so that's going to be 0 0 0 0   eight bits so that's going to be 0 0 0 0 0 so this over here is three now how do  0 so this over here is three now how do   0 so this over here is three now how do I write -2 negative numbers are written  I write -2 negative numbers are written   I write -2 negative numbers are written in two's complement what that means is  in two's complement what that means is   in two's complement what that means is we take the original number we invert  we take the original number we invert   we take the original number we invert the bits and then we add one so two  the bits and then we add one so two   the bits and then we add one so two originally would look something like  originally would look something like   originally would look something like this in 8 bit form like this now if I  this in 8 bit form like this now if I   this in 8 bit form like this now if I were to to go ahead and invert every  were to to go ahead and invert every   were to to go ahead and invert every single digit I would flip the zeros to  single digit I would flip the zeros to   single digit I would flip the zeros to be ones and the one to be a zero so now  be ones and the one to be a zero so now   be ones and the one to be a zero so now I have this and finally I just have to  I have this and finally I just have to   I have this and finally I just have to go ahead and add  go ahead and add   go ahead and add one so 1 + 1 is zero and I carry over  one so 1 + 1 is zero and I carry over   one so 1 + 1 is zero and I carry over the one so 1 + 0 is 1 and the rest are  the one so 1 + 0 is 1 and the rest are   the one so 1 + 0 is 1 and the rest are all just going to be ones so this is -2  all just going to be ones so this is -2   all just going to be ones so this is -2 and a quick check over here right how to  and a quick check over here right how to   and a quick check over here right how to tell what our numbers are the most  tell what our numbers are the most   tell what our numbers are the most significant bit the leftmost bit  significant bit the leftmost bit   significant bit the leftmost bit represents our sign so if it's zero that  represents our sign so if it's zero that   represents our sign so if it's zero that means it's positive and if it's one that  means it's positive and if it's one that   means it's positive and if it's one that means we have a negative integer and  means we have a negative integer and   means we have a negative integer and feel free to read more up on this online  feel free to read more up on this online   feel free to read more up on this online but this is what we are going to do  but this is what we are going to do   but this is what we are going to do we're going to add 3 and -2 over here  we're going to add 3 and -2 over here   we're going to add 3 and -2 over here but say to make this even simpler  but say to make this even simpler   but say to make this even simpler instead of using eight bits say I'm only  instead of using eight bits say I'm only   instead of using eight bits say I'm only using three so I'm just going to use  using three so I'm just going to use   using three so I'm just going to use this and this what would that look like  this and this what would that look like   this and this what would that look like I would basically be doing 0 1 1 which  I would basically be doing 0 1 1 which   I would basically be doing 0 1 1 which is three + 1 1 0 which is -2 now if I  is three + 1 1 0 which is -2 now if I   is three + 1 1 0 which is -2 now if I were to go ahead and add this up I would  were to go ahead and add this up I would   were to go ahead and add this up I would have one over here then 1 + 1 is 1 Z  have one over here then 1 + 1 is 1 Z   have one over here then 1 + 1 is 1 Z with one being the carry so I have one  with one being the carry so I have one   with one being the carry so I have one over here as carry and then one and one  over here as carry and then one and one   over here as carry and then one and one again so that's zero with one being the  again so that's zero with one being the   again so that's zero with one being the carry now remember I have three bits so  carry now remember I have three bits so   carry now remember I have three bits so I'm sort of truncating my answer to only  I'm sort of truncating my answer to only   I'm sort of truncating my answer to only be 0 0 1 and that makes sense right 3 +  be 0 0 1 and that makes sense right 3 +   be 0 0 1 and that makes sense right 3 + -2 is just 1 and we have one over here  -2 is just 1 and we have one over here   -2 is just 1 and we have one over here now the problem is if this was not  now the problem is if this was not   now the problem is if this was not truncated to be three bits we would  truncated to be three bits we would   truncated to be three bits we would actually continue adding this up right  actually continue adding this up right   actually continue adding this up right we would have all these ones for this -2  we would have all these ones for this -2   we would have all these ones for this -2 and we would keep carrying over the one  and we would keep carrying over the one   and we would keep carrying over the one on and on and on and that's sort of what  on and on and on and that's sort of what   on and on and on and that's sort of what python does it's not bound by three or  python does it's not bound by three or   python does it's not bound by three or eight or even 32 bits which is why this  eight or even 32 bits which is why this   eight or even 32 bits which is why this example timed out so how do we fix this  example timed out so how do we fix this   example timed out so how do we fix this we have to go ahead and truncate it our  we have to go ahead and truncate it our   we have to go ahead and truncate it our sves which means we're going to bound it  sves which means we're going to bound it   sves which means we're going to bound it by a 32bit integer I'm going to assign a  by a 32bit integer I'm going to assign a   by a 32bit integer I'm going to assign a 32bit value of all ones to a variable  32bit value of all ones to a variable   32bit value of all ones to a variable called mask now instead of writing out  called mask now instead of writing out   called mask now instead of writing out 132 times I'm just going to represent  132 times I'm just going to represent   132 times I'm just going to represent this in heximal form so that is going to  this in heximal form so that is going to   this in heximal form so that is going to be the following like this so instead of  be the following like this so instead of   be the following like this so instead of checking while B greater than zero  checking while B greater than zero   checking while B greater than zero because we could theoretically keep  because we could theoretically keep   because we could theoretically keep carrying on right what I'm going to do  carrying on right what I'm going to do   carrying on right what I'm going to do is check mask and  is check mask and   is check mask and B so the first 32 bits of B if that is  B so the first 32 bits of B if that is   B so the first 32 bits of B if that is greater than zero then we continue if  greater than zero then we continue if   greater than zero then we continue if not then I know we're just  not then I know we're just   not then I know we're just overflowing and I'm going to stop my  overflowing and I'm going to stop my   overflowing and I'm going to stop my while condition and the same applies for  while condition and the same applies for   while condition and the same applies for the return right if B is greater than  the return right if B is greater than   the return right if B is greater than zero then I want to return mask anded  zero then I want to return mask anded   zero then I want to return mask anded with a what this does is it takes the  with a what this does is it takes the   with a what this does is it takes the first 32 bits of a because any anything  first 32 bits of a because any anything   first 32 bits of a because any anything anded with something else of all ones is  anded with something else of all ones is   anded with something else of all ones is just going to keep its own value for  just going to keep its own value for   just going to keep its own value for example if I had 110 and I was anding  example if I had 110 and I was anding   example if I had 110 and I was anding that with all ones I would get 1 one one  that with all ones I would get 1 one one   that with all ones I would get 1 one one zero right because only if both of these  zero right because only if both of these   zero right because only if both of these are ones would I get a one if any is a01  are ones would I get a one if any is a01   are ones would I get a one if any is a01 I would get zero so what this means is  I would get zero so what this means is   I would get zero so what this means is I'm just keeping that first 32bit value  I'm just keeping that first 32bit value   I'm just keeping that first 32bit value of a and same for B that's all I'm  of a and same for B that's all I'm   of a and same for B that's all I'm checking and if this is not greater than  checking and if this is not greater than   checking and if this is not greater than zero else we can just return a so now if  zero else we can just return a so now if   zero else we can just return a so now if we go ahead and run this it should  we go ahead and run this it should   we go ahead and run this it should work and it's accepted so now we can go  work and it's accepted so now we can go   work and it's accepted so now we can go ahead and submit  ahead and submit   ahead and submit this and it is accepted as well so  this and it is accepted as well so   this and it is accepted as well so before leaving let's run through an  before leaving let's run through an   before leaving let's run through an example okay for our example let's use 1  example okay for our example let's use 1   example okay for our example let's use 1 and -1 and see how it goes line by line  and -1 and see how it goes line by line   and -1 and see how it goes line by line so a is going to be one and for  so a is going to be one and for   so a is going to be one and for Simplicity purposes I'm just going to  Simplicity purposes I'm just going to   Simplicity purposes I'm just going to only use three bits that way we don't  only use three bits that way we don't   only use three bits that way we don't have to keep writing things out so one  have to keep writing things out so one   have to keep writing things out so one in three bits is going to be 00 one and  in three bits is going to be 00 one and   in three bits is going to be 00 one and B is going to be again 0 0 1 we go ahead  B is going to be again 0 0 1 we go ahead   B is going to be again 0 0 1 we go ahead and invert this so it's 1 1 0 and then  and invert this so it's 1 1 0 and then   and invert this so it's 1 1 0 and then we add one and we get 1 1 1 so that  we add one and we get 1 1 1 so that   we add one and we get 1 1 1 so that means this  means this   means this is1 and this is positive one up here now  is1 and this is positive one up here now   is1 and this is positive one up here now I want to go ahead and add this up so I  I want to go ahead and add this up so I   I want to go ahead and add this up so I go into this function and mask again for  go into this function and mask again for   go into this function and mask again for Simplicity purposes let's just say it is  Simplicity purposes let's just say it is   Simplicity purposes let's just say it is a 3 bit integer made up of all ones so  a 3 bit integer made up of all ones so   a 3 bit integer made up of all ones so while mask ended with B greater than  while mask ended with B greater than   while mask ended with B greater than zero and that is true this is greater  zero and that is true this is greater   zero and that is true this is greater than zero it's all ones right now we are  than zero it's all ones right now we are   than zero it's all ones right now we are going to find our new A and B so a is  going to find our new A and B so a is   going to find our new A and B so a is going to be our sum without the carry so  going to be our sum without the carry so   going to be our sum without the carry so that's just going to be a b x or so that  that's just going to be a b x or so that   that's just going to be a b x or so that means a is now going to be 1 1 0 and our  means a is now going to be 1 1 0 and our   means a is now going to be 1 1 0 and our new B value is going to be a ended with  new B value is going to be a ended with   new B value is going to be a ended with B so that is 0 0 1 and then we shift to  B so that is 0 0 1 and then we shift to   B so that is 0 0 1 and then we shift to the left so this is now something like  the left so this is now something like   the left so this is now something like this and let's get rid of this over here  this and let's get rid of this over here   this and let's get rid of this over here so this is our new B value now we go  so this is our new B value now we go   so this is our new B value now we go back into this y Loop and B is greater  back into this y Loop and B is greater   back into this y Loop and B is greater than zero so we have our new A and B  than zero so we have our new A and B   than zero so we have our new A and B values so I'm going to write out my new  values so I'm going to write out my new   values so I'm going to write out my new a value which is 11 1 0 and my new B  a value which is 11 1 0 and my new B   a value which is 11 1 0 and my new B value which is 0 1 0 now I want to go  value which is 0 1 0 now I want to go   value which is 0 1 0 now I want to go ahead and find the exor and the carry  ahead and find the exor and the carry   ahead and find the exor and the carry again so a exor with B is is going to be  again so a exor with B is is going to be   again so a exor with B is is going to be 1 0 0 and B is going to be a and b so  1 0 0 and B is going to be a and b so   1 0 0 and B is going to be a and b so that is going to be 0 1  that is going to be 0 1   that is going to be 0 1 0 left shifted by one so this is going  0 left shifted by one so this is going   0 left shifted by one so this is going to look something like this now we go  to look something like this now we go   to look something like this now we go back into this y Loop B is still greater  back into this y Loop B is still greater   back into this y Loop B is still greater than zero so we do the same thing again  than zero so we do the same thing again   than zero so we do the same thing again our new a is 1 0 0 and our new B is 1 0  our new a is 1 0 0 and our new B is 1 0   our new a is 1 0 0 and our new B is 1 0 0 so what is a xord with B that's 0 0  0 so what is a xord with B that's 0 0   0 so what is a xord with B that's 0 0 0 and what is B equivalent to now so  0 and what is B equivalent to now so   0 and what is B equivalent to now so that's a and b which means it is 1 0 0  that's a and b which means it is 1 0 0   that's a and b which means it is 1 0 0 and then we left shift by one so that is  and then we left shift by one so that is   and then we left shift by one so that is something like this however now when we  something like this however now when we   something like this however now when we go back into our y loop we're going to  go back into our y loop we're going to   go back into our y loop we're going to mask it and we're assuming this is a 3  mask it and we're assuming this is a 3   mask it and we're assuming this is a 3 bit integer that means we only care  bit integer that means we only care   bit integer that means we only care about these digits  about these digits   about these digits here this is no longer greater than zero  here this is no longer greater than zero   here this is no longer greater than zero so we are are going to actually return  so we are are going to actually return   so we are are going to actually return and we're going to return mask and a  and we're going to return mask and a   and we're going to return mask and a because B is actually greater than zero  because B is actually greater than zero   because B is actually greater than zero so we're going to mask a and our output  so we're going to mask a and our output   so we're going to mask a and our output is going to be zero now I've added some  is going to be zero now I've added some   is going to be zero now I've added some print statements to also see how this  print statements to also see how this   print statements to also see how this would play out with all 32 bits but this  would play out with all 32 bits but this   would play out with all 32 bits but this is how we're going to be doing this and  is how we're going to be doing this and   is how we're going to be doing this and I'm actually going to adjust this print  I'm actually going to adjust this print   I'm actually going to adjust this print statement a little bit just so we can  statement a little bit just so we can   statement a little bit just so we can also see what mask and a are so mask and  also see what mask and a are so mask and   also see what mask and a are so mask and a and I'm going to take the binary of  a and I'm going to take the binary of   a and I'm going to take the binary of that and just for fun we're also going  that and just for fun we're also going   that and just for fun we're also going to see what A and B are without the  to see what A and B are without the   to see what A and B are without the binary also going to add in bin of b b  binary also going to add in bin of b b   binary also going to add in bin of b b of mask and B and also mask and B okay  of mask and B and also mask and B okay   of mask and B and also mask and B okay so let's go ahead and run this  so let's go ahead and run this   so let's go ahead and run this code and we can see all of this playing  code and we can see all of this playing   code and we can see all of this playing out right so when we go ahead and start  out right so when we go ahead and start   out right so when we go ahead and start carrying this all over we get 2 -2 44  carrying this all over we get 2 -2 44   carrying this all over we get 2 -2 44 we're basically adding all of this up  we're basically adding all of this up   we're basically adding all of this up until until we hit that 32bit Mark once  until until we hit that 32bit Mark once   until until we hit that 32bit Mark once we finally do we actually have and we  we finally do we actually have and we   we finally do we actually have and we can see in this print St over here right  can see in this print St over here right   can see in this print St over here right the binary of B is actually greater than  the binary of B is actually greater than   the binary of B is actually greater than zero it's non zero so we have to go  zero it's non zero so we have to go   zero it's non zero so we have to go ahead and truncate it so this is what  ahead and truncate it so this is what   ahead and truncate it so this is what binary of B represents it's some random  binary of B represents it's some random   binary of B represents it's some random number and when we truncate it we add  number and when we truncate it we add   number and when we truncate it we add the mask it's finally zero but it was  the mask it's finally zero but it was   the mask it's finally zero but it was greater than zero so we have to return  greater than zero so we have to return   greater than zero so we have to return mask of a and what's mask of a mask of a  mask of a and what's mask of a mask of a   mask of a and what's mask of a mask of a is zero as well so that's how to do sum  is zero as well so that's how to do sum   is zero as well so that's how to do sum of two integers I know sometimes it can  of two integers I know sometimes it can   of two integers I know sometimes it can get a little confusing using bitwise  get a little confusing using bitwise   get a little confusing using bitwise operations and just binary in general so  operations and just binary in general so   operations and just binary in general so if you have any questions at all let me  if you have any questions at all let me   if you have any questions at all let me know down below otherwise I will see you  know down below otherwise I will see you   know down below otherwise I will see you next      time\""
