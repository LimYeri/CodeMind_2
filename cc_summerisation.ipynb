problem you\\'re describing is the \"Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\" problem, which is a classic coding interview question. The goal is to find the length of the longest substring within a given string that does not contain any repeating characters.\\n\\nHere\\'s a detailed step-by-step explanation of the algorithm to solve this problem:\\n\\n1. **Initialize variables**: \\n   - `start`: Keeps track of the starting index of the current substring.\\n   - `max_length`: Stores the length of the longest substring found so far.\\n   - `char_index`: A dictionary (or hash map) that stores the last seen index of each character in the string.\\n\\n2. **Iterate through the string**:\\n   - For each character in the string:\\n     - If the character is not in the `char_index` dictionary or the current index is greater than the last seen index of the character:\\n       - Update the `char_index` dictionary with the current index of the character.\\n       - Calculate the length of the current substring by subtracting the `start` index from the current index and adding 1.\\n       - Update the `max_length` variable if the current substring length is greater than the previous `max_length`.\\n     - If the character is in the `char_index` dictionary and the last seen index is less than or equal to the current `start` index:\\n       - Update the `char_index` dictionary with the current index of the character.\\n       - Calculate the length of the current substring by subtracting the `start` index from the current index and adding 1.\\n       - Update the `max_length` variable if the current substring length is greater than the previous `max_length`.\\n     - If the character is in the `char_index` dictionary and the last seen index is greater than the current `start` index:\\n       - Update the `start` index to be one more than the last seen index of the character.\\n       - Update the `char_index` dictionary with the current index of the character.\\n       - Calculate the length of the current substring by subtracting the `start` index from the current index and adding 1.\\n       - Update the `max_length` variable if the current substring length is greater than the previous `max_length`.\\n\\n3. **Return the `max_length`**: After iterating through the entire string, the `max_length` variable will contain the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\\n\\nThe key aspects of this algorithm are:\\n- Using a dictionary (or hash map) to keep track of the last seen index of each character in the string.\\n- Updating the `start` index whenever a repeating character is encountered, to ensure that the current substring does not contain any repeating characters.\\n- Continuously updating the `max_length` variable to keep track of the longest substring found so far.\\n\\nBy following this step-by-step approach, you can efficiently solve the \"Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\" problem.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":57}]},{"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":["# df['summary'] =
